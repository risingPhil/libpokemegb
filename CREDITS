CREDITS
================================================================

First of all, I want to thank the people behind Bulbapedia. The documentation was extensive and without it, I never would've started on this project.

Secondly, I'd like to extend my thanks to Alex "IsoFrieze" Losego from the Retro Game Mechanics Explained Youtube channel. His videos on the topic of Gen 1 sprite
decompression were pretty helpful.

I don't know the identity of the authors of the Pokémon gen 1 and 2 ROM maps on datacrystal.romhacking.net, but these were a valuable resource as well.

I also want to thank the community behind the pokecrystal project. Without them, I would'nt as easily have found the rom offsets of the pokémon front sprites for Pokémon Crystal.

And of course I'd like to extend my thanks to everyone else in the pokémunity who wrote documentation or code for these old pokémon games. 

Below, I've listed an overview of the documents and other resources used during the initial development of this library.

While several github repos are listed, I didn't copy any of the code. Instead I used these as reference while debugging some of the bugs I encountered.
